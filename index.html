        <p> Hi, I'm Arturs, a dedicated and enthusiastic individual currently interning as a Front End Developer at Happierleads.
          <br>
          <br>
          I began my journey in 2022 by self-studying the fundamentals of front-end web development and
          having a life-long passion for technology I quickly fell in love with the field.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the second half of 2022, I enrolled in a full-time EDX Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development
          to
          further my education and skills. It was an incredible journey and I am happy to say that at the end of
          March 2023 I successfully graduated from the bootcamp with a certificate in hand.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout the bootcamp, I was able to refine my skills in HTML5, GIT, CSS3 and JavaScript (including jQuery,
          ES6, Node.js, npm, Jest, Enzyme and React). The bootcamp provided me with ample
          opportunities to put my learning into practice through daily collaborative challenges, weekly individual
          projects and a few larger collaborative projects. Through my work on these assignments, I was able to continue developing my
          skills in an Agile environment, working closely with others to explore the complexities
          of Javascript and expand my knowledge of powerful tools such as React and Firebase.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now, in my role as an intern Front-End Developer, I'm actively applying and expanding my knowledge while working on various aspects of front-end web development. I'm part of a dynamic team, engaging in real-world projects and continuing to learn and grow in this exciting field.
