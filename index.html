        <p> Hi, I'm Arturs, a dedicated and enthusiastic individual pursuing a career as a Software Engineer. <br> I began my
          journey in the summer of 2022 by self-studying the fundamentals of front-end web development and having a
          life-long passion for technology I quickly fell in love with the field. In November 2022, I enrolled in a
          full-time EDX Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development to further my education and skills. The
          bootcamp has been an incredibly transformative experience, where I have honed my skills in HTML5, GIT, CSS3,
          JavaScript, and jQuery, and now before graduation at the end of March 2023 I am ready to tackle the fundamentals of React, ES6,
          and Node.js as well as the final team project.
          The bootcamp has given me numerous opportunities to apply my learning through daily collaborative challenges
          and weekly individual projects as well as a recent team of 3 challenge project called "SunTrack." This project
          allowed me to practice working in an Agile environment and collaborate with my classmates, while utilizing the
          skills I have learned such as HTML5, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and various JavaScript libraries. This project as
          well as other most recently finished projects can be seen below in My Work section. <br>
          I am ready and very eager to continue learning and applying my skills in a professional setting.
