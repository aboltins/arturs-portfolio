# Arturs Portfolio

Portfolio including About Me Section, Work Portfolio and Contact Me section.

## Description

I have created my portfolio page as part of the Edx Front-End Web Development Challenge number 2.

I will keep updating my portfolio as i progress through the very exciting journey of Front End Development.

Acceptance Criteria for this Porfolio Challenge:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.

When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
